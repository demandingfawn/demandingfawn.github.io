# Project 1 Report
This is a web-based VR creation that allows a user to navigate through a rough model of my room. This application was created using A-frame on glitch. 

The model can be accessed [here](http:/demandingfawn.github.io)

Video of the model demo can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k09PpmPXCpE)

## Room Features
The following screenshots show some of the models found in the application

### Desk

This image shows the entire desk. here I created a basic chair instead of a more complex chair as premade models would alter the overall lighting or not appear. The desk is made of two different parts, the table top with 2 wooden legs that I made and the white Ikea Alex drawers. The computer on the floor and the Vr headset were also premade models. the moniter was made and shows a screenshot of my current desktop. The source for all the premade models will be found at the bottem of the readme.

### Fan and Door

For the fan, I created it by hand. The base is a cone, with the body being cylinders and the blades being rectangles. Since in my real life the fan in my room is constanly running i decided to animate the fan's blades spinning. I did this by having both of the rectangles rotate 90 degrees and repeat. The doors are premade models. 

### Bed

I also created my bed to be close to how it is currently in real life. This was done with several triagles that had various textures. The source of the textures can also be found at the bottem of the readme. The bedside table were also created by me. The alarm clock was a premade model and was meant to play one of my reoomates playing their instrument, but I will cover that later in the readme.

### Small Table

I created the table using rectangles and rotating them to make the slanted legs. The books and the window were premade. I was going to create windows by had, but after creating some of the objects before I got to them, it was going to be eaiser to just bring in a model and move it to where they needed to be.

## Problems encountered
I had began this project with the idea of including click to change the lighting. make sounds and change images. That idea collasped however as for some reason I could not get click to do anything to work. I had tried to create different javascript files, messing with "on:click" commands and hold over cursor clicks, but nothing would happen. The plan was to be able to alter the lighting from bright to dim (day/night), play a recording of my roomates playing their instruments by clicking the clock, and being able to change the picture that the moniter showed. I had also ran into a problem animating the fan spinning. I had one of the blades moving properly, but the other would either move in the opposite direction than it was intended to or it would move to a completely space entirely. After some time I discovered that I was moving the second blade on the wrond axis and wrong position on the right axis. The windows looking into the wall was something that I had acceptted. I had thought about putting a plane with an image behind the windows to create the feeling of them being real windows through a wall, but that would have caused more problems that it would fix. In retrospect I believe that I could have potentially made a clear box that created a view outside. If I was to redo this project, that is what I would do for the windows.
